## Legacy Content

This folder contains older exploratory scripts and MATLAB files kept for reference.

- `experiments/`: unrelated prototypes and scratch experiments.
- `matlab/`: original MATLAB versions of data generation and validation scripts.
- `data/`: legacy MATLAB `.mat` trajectory file.

The recommended current workflow is Python-only from the repository root.
